# ParrotAI

## Introduction
A parrot-like chatbot that is funny and somewhat realistic in Java/JavaFX.

## Chat Bots
The ParrotAI provides a base for chat bots, but is centered mainly on ParrotAI.

### Parrot Bot
The AI behind the parrot bot is simple yet effective. The following simplistic model of a parrot should allow for complex behavior to emerge once in a while:
* Random squawking
* Occasionally echoes back user's input
* Ocassionally repeats previous user's input
* Unpredictably become furious and capitalize replies with !!!

### Echo Bot
The AI behind the echo bot is brainless. It simply replies back with exactly what you sent it.

### Random Bot
The AI behind the random bot is slightly more interesting than Echo bot. It takes in the user's message and splits it into words, then jumbles that, and reconstructs it into a string and thats the output. With more processing and finetuning, this could be a great Baby Yoda Bot. :)

### Baby Yoda Bot
The AI behind the baby yoda bot is a simple GET request to an online Yoda API. For more info about the Yoda API, head [here](https://github.com/richchurcher/yoda-api).

## Prerequisites
This project was built in Eclipse 2019, thus JavaFX installation is necessary for the project to run.
Also, it uses json-simple-1.1 library that was downloaded from [here](http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/j/Downloadjsonsimple11jar.htm).
